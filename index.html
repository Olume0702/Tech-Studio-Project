              I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior
              knowledge in software development. However, within a few weeks, I
              was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master
              the soft skills required for being a software developer. So far so
              good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my
              career as a software developer.

              fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were
              presented to us. I got my first gig immediately after the program.
              Thank you Tech Studio for that push I needed.

            <h5>Why Is This Course Relevant Today?</h5>
            <p>
              There's never been a better time to start a career as a web
              developer because there <br />
              is a consistent demand for developers who both write high-quality
              code and <br />
              experienced problem solvers who can design creative solutions.
              <br />
              The web and the applications built for it have transformed the way
              we do business <br />
              globally, and is disrupting industries from education to
              manufacturing.
            </p>
            <h5>
              What Practical Skill Sets Can I Expect To Have Upon Completion Of
              The Course?
            </h5>
            <p>
              By the end of the course, you will have gained practice in the
              most used web-based <br />
              programming language – JavaScript. You’ll have built several
              full-stack applications <br />
              of varying complexity, and have experience working with a team in
              a development <br />
              environment. You’ll gain confidence in tackling new technologies
              in an ever-changing field. You’ll <br />
              have gained foundational skill in many disciplines that touch web
              development – <br />
              managing complex data sets, securing your applications with
              encrypted passwords, <br />
              and testing and deploying your applications to prepare them to
              scale.
            </p>
            <h5>Should I Come Equipped With Anything?</h5>
            <p>
              Yes, a laptop is required (either Mac or PC) with a minimum of 4GB
              RAM with a <br />
              storage capacity of at least 350GB. The <br />
              course will walk you through installing the necessary free
              software. <br />
              At least, you’ll require basic secondary school mathematics, but
              no previous <br />
              programming language experience is required.
